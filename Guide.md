# Basic Types

- int: int type size is platform-dependent and will be either 32 or 64 bits
- uint: positive int
- byte: alias for uint8, represent a byte of data
- rune: alias for int32, represent a single Unicode code point (a single character). 'A', '\n', '\u00A5', 'Â¥'.
  Characters, glyphs, and escape sequences are enclosed in single quotes (the ' character).'
- float64

# Pointer

- Define a pointer: use address operator
- Follow/read a pointer: use asterisk
